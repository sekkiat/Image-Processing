# Hand Signature Verification System 
## Offline Based Signature Recognition (Biometrics)

HSVS is a user friendly system to conduct siganture recognition by using SURF algorithm and feature extraction.

The system is required to input the original signature and verification signature to verify whether the signature of the user is valid or invalid.

Figure below shows the example of the process of the original signature once the user input the original signature into the system.

In this experimental results, there are five (5) different users and each users have several types of signature to be used for the tesing such as genuine signature, skilled forgery signature, unskilled forgery signature and random forgey signature to compare with the original signature. The results of the comparison signature will be shown in a graph.

# Conclusion

SURF has lower matching rate compared to other algorithms such as SIFT. Therefore, the signature must have very high similar degree to allow the system to verify the signature. Every signature recognition system is encouraged to implement the algorithm, which has higher matching rate to reduce the false reject rate (FRR) of the signature.
